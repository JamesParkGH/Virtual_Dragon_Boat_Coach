            <h2>Preparation</h2>
            <p>To use VDBC, prepare the following equipment:</p>
            <ul class="resource_list">
                <li>An OpenCap account. Users can register for free on the OpenCap official website: <a href="https://app.opencap.ai/login" target="_blank">https://app.opencap.ai/login</a> </li>
                <li>Minimum of 2 iOS devices (iPhone or iPad) with functional cameras and the OpenCap mobile application installed.</li>
                <li>Tripods with mounts compatible with the iOS devices being used.</li>
                <li>Checkerboard for calibration. A picture of a checkerboard on a tablet or laptop will suffice as long as the screen does not produce any glare or reflections. A standard checkerboard can be found here: <a href="https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/62468717bed6b421c89bbf36/6258dd3518244b061c1b02f5_Checkerboard_4x5_35mm.pdf" target="_blank">Checkerboard</a></li>
                <li>Laptop with internet connection capabilities.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>**Note: Recording sessions should be performed with at least two people: one will be the “paddler” who will have their technique assessed and the other will be responsible for operating OpenCap.</p>

                    <li>From the OpenCap homepage, select the ‘Start Recording’ button.</li>
                    <li>Scan the session’s QR code through the <strong>OpenCap mobile application</strong> on iOS devices being used for filming.</li>
                    <li>Mount the cameras onto the tripods and place them 1-2 meters from the ergometer at 30-45° off the line facing forward from the paddler.</li>
                    <ul class="resource_list">
                        <li>Try to minimize the number of people in the background of each camera’s field of view.</li>

                <ol class="resource_list">
                    <li>Place the checkerboard in the field of view of both cameras. This can be on the seat of the ergometer and facing directly forwards.</li>
                        <ul class="resource_list"><li>Note: The checkerboard must be placed horizontally and should NOT point directly at any of the cameras.</li></ul>

                        <ul class="resource_list"><li>The <strong>default checkerboard (provided)</strong> is 4 rows, 5 columns and 35mm square size</li></ul>
                    <li>Select the ‘Calibrate’ option. You may need to wait for a few moments before getting a response from the system.</li>
                    <li>If the calibration was successful, you will be brought to a new page. If it failed, carefully review the previous instructions and try again.</li>

                <ol class="resource_list">
                    <li>Enter the paddler’s basic information including height (m), weight (kg), gender and an identifier for this paddler.</li>
                    <li>In the ‘Data sharing agreement’ section, select any of the options in the dropdown according to your preference.</li>
                    <li>Have the paddler stand in a neutral pose in the field of view of both cameras to record a 2 second neutral pose video. They should be standing at approximately where the calibration checkerboard was placed (you will need to move the machine out of the way).</li>
                        <ul class="resource_list"><li>Ensure the paddler does not move until a pop-up appears on the screen indicating they can do so.</li></ul>
                    <li>If successful you will be brought to the next page. Otherwise, carefully review the previous instructions and try again.</li>
                    <li>On the new page, start recording a new trial by entering a trial name in the field near the top-left corner of the page.</li>
                    <li>Have the paddler begin taking strokes and select ‘Start recording’ after a few seconds to give them time to get accustomed to the machine. Stop the recording after around 10 to 15 seconds.</li>
                        <ul class="resource_list"><li>Note: While recording the paddler CANNOT switch sides or stop paddling. If this occurs, please start a new trial</li></ul>
                    <li>After the recording is stopped, wait for the trial to finish processing. This may take some time. When finished, the coloured circle beside the trial name should change from yellow to green.</li>
                    <li>From the ‘Share session’ option on the left side of the page, indicate that you wish to share the session URL publicly. This URL will be used later.</li>
